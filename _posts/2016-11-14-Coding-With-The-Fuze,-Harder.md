    <td>I learnt about creating images in your Fuze. It was easy because the booklet showed you a grid and what you had to do to light up some of the boxes, the boxes were numbered and so you just needed to write in simple code:               (N=a random number )
DEFCHAR (N, N, N, N, N, N)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>We missed a bit of important coding:
PRINT (Which makes it appear)
INK=PINK (The colour)
WAIT (0,5) (How long you had to wait before the next image)
chr$(1) (The order it is in the other image)
REPEAT (Repeat, obviously) </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>By making sure I watch out for missing or incorrect coding so that I don't lose precious time by having to add or correct code </td>
