We are starting a new project, called python on codecademy. Codecademy is an amazing website to learn to code, with lots of different courses with thing like JavaScript, Ruby, Git and   jQuery.

In my opinion, apart from The Fuze, Python is the only raw code course we have done. It is really well-made so that it starts **really** easy but slowly gets harder so sometimes one level takes up to 1/2 hrs (that's what I heard anyway)

Python gives you badges ( like when you complete 10 levels) I have got 11 shown on below.
