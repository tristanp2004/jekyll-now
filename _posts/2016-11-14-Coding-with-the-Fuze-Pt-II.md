    <td>I went a bit deeper into coding with the Fuze. I didn't do much differently from yesterday apart from the coding being a bit more tricky. But since there was a picture of  the code that needed to be done. So a long as I make no mistakes, which in my target I said I didn’t make any, everything went well.</td>

    <td>Well, I realized right at the start the computer that I was using had a glitchy screen and kept turning off and on so that delayed me quite significantly and I think if that didn’t happen I wouldn’t of had anything to write in this box.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Change to a different computer quicker when and if I realize it has a faulty screen or anything like that because then I wouldn’t have to rush everything else. I was quite ashamed about how long it took me to plug into the back of the computer because it was really quite simple.</td>
