Python is getting much harder now…

Last week I managed to do 2 of the 13 courses and this week I haven't even finished half of one!

While it was harder for most of them, however, it was manageable until this question that I had to finish at home, it was really hard! When I looked at the hint and tried to use the new knowledge to help me nothing happened! It was only after one of my friends (Felix from Pearson, don't know his surname, he sits to the right of me) put me on the right path I worked it out. I felt very annoyed that I had spent all that time doing everything wrong :’( .
