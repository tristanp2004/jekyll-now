    <td>Lightbot is a game where you have to make a little robot light up the dark blue squares (through code, obviously, it's IT!) It had a step by step guide, which helped loads, I also got help from other people (mostly Felix), which very kind, especially on Stage 2 lvl 6, which was reeeeaalllllllyyyyyyy tricky.

The best strategies for if I got stuck, were trying it every regular interval, then seeing what happened, then carrying on.</td>

    <td>The main limitation for me was being just introduced to the game, I had to do it slowly, so I remembered all the techniques. I think I have to learn to adapt quicker, so that I can get through things quicker.</td>
