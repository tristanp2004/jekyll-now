  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>Knowing quite a bit about the Fuze</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>Manage to get through more than 2 pieces of code</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target?
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes I did, I did 1 long piece of code and 3 short pieces of code</td>
  </tr>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Be VERY precise with the code because literally 1 letter could make the program not work</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>We made 1 mistake, not putting in a line of code which make the program say 'error in line 14'. It hindered my working and therefore I couldn’t do an extra piece of work</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I know I’ve said this before, it seems like I’m not learning [even though I am!] Look out for those little mistakes, it could completely change[or jam] the code</td>
  </tr>
