It's the first Yr 9 IT lesson of the year and we are learning about google sheets.

Google sheets is a particular type of coding made specifically for lists, bills and receipts aswell as a lot more. 

We got taught how to make a very basic receipt, using code to make things a lot simpler ans easier.
